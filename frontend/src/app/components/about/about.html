        <p class="about-text">I am Emma.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Italian, brown hair, green eyes.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Currently based in Lisbon.</p>
        <p class="about-text">I started photography in 2023, though my eyes had been training to be a photographer long before.</p>
        <p class="about-text">At 15, my father placed a camera in my hands, a gift I wasn't ready to hold yet. But moving to Portugal awakened me, and lit a fire that still burns bright.</p>
        <p class="about-text">My focus? Nature, humans, surf. Nothing stillness can’t touch, and nothing movement can’t blur. Still figuring it out, but enjoying every step.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Words may slip from me, but images hold me steady. Photography found me, and through its lens I speak.</p>
        <p class="about-text">I hope we speak the same language, and that you will understand my message. And if you find your own way to say it, even better.</p>
